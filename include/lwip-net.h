/**
 * Helper struct to hold private data used to operate the ethernet interface.
 * The user can pre-initialize some values (e.g., providing a mac address,
 * passing a opened netfront_dev struct) and lwIP will use those passed data
 * instead. For values that are not set (e.g., dev is NULL, hwaddress is
 * zero), lwIP will retrieve them from the interface.
 *
 * If no netfrontif struct is passed (via netif->state), lwIP is opening and
 * managing one by itself. lwIP will only close self-opened devices on
 * netif_exit().
